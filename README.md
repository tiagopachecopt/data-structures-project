# Data Structures Project

Academic project focused on learning data structures, how to use them, and when each one is most appropriate.

## Modules

This repository contains three main modules:

- **ED_API** – Core data structures and algorithms  
- **ED_GAME** – Game application that uses the data structures  
- **ED_GAME_API** – Game logic and simulation API  

## Technologies

- Java  
- Gradle  

## Objective

The goal of this project is to apply data structures and algorithms in a practical context, using a game and simulation system.
